Amaranthaceae_Achyranthes_mutica
Transcription:	3. Achyranthes mutica A. Gray [A. nelsonii St. John] (end, Ex) Shrubs; stems 30-60 cm long, many-branched. Leaves obovate to elliptic or oblanceolate, (1.9-)3.2-4 cm long, (0.8-) 1.5-2 cm wide, young leaves sparsely pilose, usually glabrate with age, petioles 0.3– 1.5 cm long. Spikes 0.4-1.5 cm long, the rachis densely pubescent with spreading hairs, sessile; sepals unequal, 3–4.2 mm long, apex acute, subtended by a broadly ovate, acute to minutely spine-tipped bract 1-1.3 mm long, bracteoles broadly ovate, 1.8-2.3 mm long. Utricles unknown. Known only from 2 collections: Rémy 208 (GH, BISH) from Kaua'i collected between 1851 and 1855; and Nelson s.n. (BM) supposedly from Hawai'i, collected in 1779. Achyranthes mutica apparently existed as a few scattered relictual populations at the time the only 2 collections were made. St. John (1976a) described A. nelsonii from the Nelson collection, which he assumes was collected on the island of Hawai'i. Although these 2 collections supposedly are from opposite ends of the main archipelago, they differ only in minor ways. The Nelson collection has more pubescent leaves and pseudostaminodia 2.5 mm long; divided into 3-4 lobes, whereas the Rémy specimen has pseudostaminodia 0.5 mm long, divided into 2-3 lobes.

Probst] Monoecious annual herbs; stems sometimes tinged reddish or yellowish, erect, ascending, or prostrate, 0.6–6(-9) dm long, unbranched or branched, striate, glabrous, rarely with unicellular to multicellular short hairs, especially above. Leaves ovate to rhombic-ovate, blades 1-8 cm long, 0.6-6 cm wide, glabrous, rarely the lower surface with scattered multicellular hairs along the veins, apex usually broad, widely emarginate, petioles 0.5-10 cm long. Flowers green, in slender to stout axillary or terminal spikes, rarely panicles, both sexes mixed throughout the spikes, bracts and bracteoles whitish, deltate-ovate to lanceolate, membranous, tipped with a short yellow or reddish mucro; sepals 3(4), lanceolate-oblong to spatulate, 0.7-2 mm long, apex subacute, mucronate, apex of pistillate flowers often more blunt; stigmas 2-3. Fruit globose to pyriform, compressed, exceeding the sepals, 1.2–2.5 mm long, indehiscent or rupturing irregularly at maturity, the surface smooth, occasionally wrinkled upon drying. Seeds dark brown to black, shiny, the margins duller, compressed, 1-1.8 mm long, faintly reticulate, minutely punctate-roughened. [2n = 16, 34.] Cosmopolitan in warmer regions; in Hawai'i apparently sparingly naturalized in disturbed areas on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu and Hawaiʻi. The earliest collection we have seen was made on Oʻahu in 1971 (K. Nagata 910, BISH); however, the earliest collection may be that made on Maui in 1869-1872 (Wawra 2303, W, not seen). Our plants are referred to subsp. polygonoides, which is distinct in having smaller leaves, rarely more than 4 cm long, usually prostrate to decumbent stems, and fruit 1.2–1.8 mm long.

Shrubs or small trees, branched from base or rarely a single trunk with a branched crown; stems (0.8–)1–4(–7) m long, 2-10 cm in diameter, silky canescent with straight, appressed hairs. Leaves usually elliptic, often broadly so, to ovate, broadly ovate, or lanceolate, rarely obovate, (1.5-)3-10(-13) cm long, (1-)2-4(-7.6) cm wide, usually densely pubescent with closely appressed or sometimes spreading hairs, especially on lower surface, upper surface usually less densely pubescent or sometimes only sparsely pubescent or rarely glabrate, apex acuminate, acute, or obtuse, rarely retuse, base cuneate or obtuse; petiole [length missing in original OCR, likely 5-15] mm long. Flowers lanceoloid to narrowly ovoid, in stout spikes 0.5-3(-5) cm long, 5-10 mm in diameter; peduncles (0.5-)2-5(-7.5) cm long; sepals lanceolate to ovate, 2–3(–4) mm long, pubescent with long hairs and with a large tuft of spreading hairs at base, rarely glabrous, subtended by an ovate, scarious bract ca. 1.5–2.5 mm long, usually persistent on the rachis; bracteoles ovate to lanceolate, scarious, ca. 1.5–2 mm long, ± with a spine ca. 2 mm long, usually persistent, enclosing the calyx and fruit. Fruit ca. 2 mm long, enclosed by the calyx. Scattered to sometimes common in open dry forest, on exposed ridges, and lava fields, 0–750 m, on all of the main islands. - Plate 6.
Sherff described over 20 varieties of Nototrichium sandwicense based upon pubescence density, leaf size, and the shape and length of the spikes. These characters are often quite variable even on a single plant. Based on current information, it does not seem possible to subdivide the species. Moreover, N. viride, which has been separated from N. sandwicense based on being less densely pubescent and having shorter stamens and styles, seems doubtfully distinct. The less densely pubescent leaves of plants assigned to N. viride appear to only represent extreme endpoints of a rather continuously variable character. When we examined a number of specimens, we also found the stamen and style length feature to be quite variable, and thus it cannot be the basis for separation of 2 species. The illustration of Nototrichium viride by Degener, Degener, and Stone (1960) is clearly N. humile, and the material it was based upon is probably not from Kaua'i. The text indicates that the specimen illustrated is Stone 830, which we could not locate; however, a specimen of N. humile that closely matches the illustration is Stone 900 (BISH) from the Wai'anae Mountains, O'ahu. The Stone 900 collection is labeled N. viride, in further support that it was the basis of the illustration. Furthermore, Degener et al. (1960) state that Stone 830 was collected along the Napali Coast, Kaua'i, in June 1955, but the only material of Nototrichium Stone collected at that time is a specimen of N. sandwicense (St. John & Stone 25544, BISH).

Transcription:	Neleau, neneleau. Rhus sandwicensis A. Gray [R. chinensis Mill. var. sandwicensis (A. Gray) Degener & Greenwell; R. semialata J. A. Murray var. sandwicensis Engl.] Small trees 3–8 m tall, with milky sap, producing numerous suckers from spreading roots to form dense patches; stems with prominent lenticels. Leaves green on upper surface, lower surface paler, young leaves often red, odd-pinnately compound with (2)3–5(6) pairs of leaflets, alternate, lateral leaflets oblong-elliptic to lanceolate, (5–)7–16 cm long, 2.5–6 cm wide, the terminal leaflet ovate, very broadly elliptic to lanceolate, (5–)9–14 cm long, (2.5–)3–6(–9.5) cm wide, veins prominent on lower surface, upper surface sparsely short-villous to strigillose, the hairs reddish brown, lower surface moderately to densely so, margins serrate to crenate, apex acute to acuminate, base often oblique, petioles 6–10(–17) cm long. Flowers apparently perfect, in dense terminal panicles, densely reddish brown tomentose; sepals 5, lanceolate, ca. 1–1.5 mm long, margins ciliate; petals 5, pale yellow, elliptic, ca. 3–3.5 mm long, margins ± ciliate; stamens 5. Drupes red, globose, somewhat depressed, tomentose. Scattered in relatively wet to dry, disturbed areas, especially along roadsides and in pastures, 150–750(–2,150) m, from Makaweli, Kaua`i (now known only from a newly discovered population at Kamali`i Ridge; R. Hobdy, pers. comm.); Nu`uanu and Moanalua valleys and Ho`omaluhia, O`ahu; Pelekunu Valley, Moloka`i; and scattered localities on Maui and Hawai`i; the species is most common in areas near Hilo and Waimea (Kamuela), Hawai`i.—Plate 6. Hillebrand (1888) mentions that the plants are "apparently dioecious"; however, the specimens that we examined were all morphologically perfect. The breeding system of this species is in need of study. The wood is lightweight, coarse-textured, and tough and was formerly used for saddle trees, yokes, and plows. The bark was once used locally for tanning.

Trees 3–4.5 m tall. Leaflets 3 (occasionally 5 on juvenile leaves), subcoriaceous, elliptic to ovate, 5-12 cm long and less than 1/2 as wide, veins strongly sunken on upper surface in dried material (weakly so in juvenile leaves), margins entire, apex rounded-acute to acuminate, base narrowly cuneate to attenuate, petioles 3-7(-10 in juvenile leaves) cm long, petiolules 0.5-1.5 cm long, subterete. Inflorescences up to 10 cm long, pedicels 3-6 mm long; ovary (4)5-carpellate; styles (4)5, 1-1.5 mm long, connate 1/2– 3/4 their length into a conical-cylindrical stylopodium, the distinct arms divergent to spreading. Fruit globose, weakly (4)5-sided (strongly ribbed when dry), 4-5 mm long (incl. styles). Occurring in wet forest, 600-890 m, Mount Kahili, north fork of Kamo-'oloa Stream, Makaleha Mountains, and the Powerline Trail, Kaua'i.
This taxon was originally described as Cheirodendron kauaiense var. forbesii, but clearly warrants recognition at the species level. A possible hybrid involving C. forbesii and C. fauriei (Lowry 3515, BISH, F, K, MO, NY, P, US) was recently collected on Mount Kahili, where both putative parents occur. This collection has the distinctive upper leaf surface of C. forbesii, a usually 3-carpellate ovary, and leaflets intermediate in shape between the putative parents, a combination of characters not seen in any other specimen.

Asteraceae_Tetramolopium_filiforme
Transcription:	366. Tetramolopium filiforme Sherff [T. f. var. polyphyllum (Sherff) Lowrey; T. polyphyllum Sherff]
Monoecious, somewhat cespitose, dwarf shrubs 5-15 cm tall; stems intricately branched at base, glabrous when mature except for ciliate leaf bases, minutely capitate glandular when young. Leaves clustered at apex, linear to linear-filiform with margins entire, or linear-oblanceolate with margins coarsely dentate and teeth linear, 10-20 mm long, 0.4-1.2 mm wide, glandular punctate and sparsely strigose on margins and midribs, sessile or petiolate. Heads solitary or 2-4 in subumbellate inflorescences, peduncles (1.9-)2-4.7 cm long, sparsely to densely capitate glandular, bracts linear; involucre campanulate, 4-5 mm high, 7-10 mm in diameter, bracts (32-)40-50(-59), lanceolate, glabrous abaxially, outer involucral bracts with sparsely glandular margins, inner ones scarious hyaline-margined, lacerate at apex, acuminate; receptacle 1.5-2.5 mm in diameter; ray florets 35-52 per head, in a single series, rays white or pale lavender, 3-4 mm long, (0.5-)0.7-1 mm wide; disk florets functionally staminate, 18-30 per head, corollas maroon or rarely yellow, narrowly funnelform, 3.1-4(-4.3) mm long, the tube 1.3-2.1 mm long; anther tips linear-lanceolate, 0.15-0.2 mm long; pappus white, 2.2-3.2 mm long. Achenes oblanceoloid, 2-2.7 mm long, fertile achenes 0.6-1 mm wide, sparsely glandular strigose to glabrous, faces (0)1-3-nerved. [2n = 18*.]
Two varieties of Tetramolopium filiforme are recognized: var. filiforme with linear to linear-filiform leaves with entire margins (xeric cliff faces below 770 m on Ōhikilolo Ridge and Keaʻau Valley); and var. polyphyllum with linear-oblanceolate leaves with coarsely dentate margins (common, known only from dry ridge habitats, 580-900 m, including scattered mesic slopes above 770 m, on Ōhikilolo Ridge and adjacent Keaʻau Valley, Waiʻanae Mountains, Oʻahu). —Plate 36.
Variety filiforme usually flowers a few weeks earlier than var. polyphyllum. The populations of the 2 varieties were probably contiguous in the past but became separated recently due to heavy erosion. This erosion is largely the result of overgrazing by feral goats. The varieties are nearly sympatric yet they maintain their morphological integrity. Growth studies of the varieties conducted under uniform conditions show the morphological differences to be genetically based.

[2n = 28*.] Widely distributed from Hawaiʻi nearly throughout Polynesia; in Hawaiʻi occurring in sandy sites in coastal areas on Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, and apparently rare on Maui and Hawaiʻi, perhaps formerly also on Lānaʻi and Kahoʻolawe. Plate 41.
Our plants are referred to the endemic var. argenteum, which is similar to var. anomalum except it has closely appressed, silky pubescence.

Brassicaceae_Sisymbrium_officinale
Transcription:	SISYMBRIUM Hedge mustard. Sisymbrium officinale (L.) Scop.
[Erysimum officinale L.; Sisymbrium officinale var. leiocarpum DC] Erect, unbranched to many-branched annual herbs, hirsute at least below. Leaves lyrate-pinnatifid to pinnately divided, 7–15 cm long, usually 3–7 cm wide, the segments coarsely dentate, upper leaves smaller, lanceolate to hastate. Pedicels stout, erect, ca. 2 mm long in fruit; sepals ca. 2 mm long, sparsely hirsute; petals pale yellow, ca. 3 mm long. Siliques subulate, strictly erect and appressed to the stem, 1–2 cm long, hirsute or glabrous. Seeds ca. 1 mm long. [2n = 14.] Native to Europe, now widely naturalized; in Hawai'i naturalized in cultivated land and pastures on Kauaʻi, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Maui, and Hawaiʻi.—Plate 47.
Two minor varieties, both present in Hawai'i, are often recognized: var. leiocarpum with racemes, pedicels, and fruit glabrous (Lānaʻi and Hawaiʻi), first collected on Hawaiʻi in 1911 (Forbes 201.H, BISH); and var. officinale with racemes, pedicels, and fruit hirsute (distribution in Hawai'i same as the species), first collected on Hawaiʻi in 1909 (Rock 3162, BISH). The presence or absence of hairs may be rather simple genetically and may not represent 2 independent colonization events of this weed.

Cactaceae_Cereus_hildmannianus
Transcription:	(nat)[C. peruvianus sensu auct., non Mill.]1. Cereus uruguayanus Ritter ex R. Kiesling
Plants arborescent, up to 6 m tall, branched; stems cylindrical, 10-20 cm in diameter, ribs 6-9, rarely fewer. Areoles gray or brown, spines 6-8 per areole, brown or black, 1-4 cm long. Flowers nocturnal, 12-15 cm long, 8-10 cm in diameter; sepaloid perianth parts green or slightly pinkish, narrowly oblong to narrowly lanceolate, 4–5 cm long, 0.9-1.2 cm wide, inner perianth parts white, oblanceolate, 4.5-7.5 cm long, 1-2 cm wide; staminal filaments greenish; style green, 7.5-10 cm long; stigma lobes 12-15, green, ca. 1 cm long. Berries reddish or yellowish orange, 5-7.5 cm long, 4.5-5 cm in diameter, smooth or with a few scales, splitting along one side and exposing a sweet white pulp. [2n = 22.]
Native to southern Brazil, Uruguay, and northeastern Argentina, now widely cultivated as an ornamental throughout warm parts of the world; in Hawai'i naturalized on southern Kauaʻi where it was reportedly introduced by the Moir family (Benson, 1982). First collected in 1959 (Au S.n., BISH).
This species has long gone under the name of Cereus peruvianus (L.) Mill. A recent study by Kiesling (1982), however, has shown that C. peruvianus Mill. is a Caribbean species different from Cactus peruvianus L., which has always been assumed to be the basionym of Miller's name. Cactus peruvianus is apparently based on at least 2 species, neither of which can be determined due to an absence of authentic material.

[*B. citrina* (C. Forbes & Lydgate) St. John; *B. citrina* var. *napaliensis* St. John; *B. insignis* f. *citrina* C. Forbes & Lydgate]
St. John (1969a) segregated the Kauaʻi populations as *Brighamia citrina* on the basis of minor differences in the pubescence of the staminal column and the shape of the papillae of the seed. However, the Niʻihau and Kauaʻi populations are here judged conspecific on the basis of their common possession of yellow corollas, papillose seeds, pedicels 1–3 cm long, and deltate to ovate calyx lobes up to 1 mm long. Last observed on Niʻihau in 1947 (St. John, 1969a).
Leaves 12–20 cm long, 6.5–11 cm wide. Peduncle plus rachis 4–12 cm long, pedicels 10–30 mm long; hypanthium 10–12 mm long, 4.5–7 mm wide; calyx lobes deltate to ovate, 0.2–1 mm long; corolla yellow, the tube 7–14 cm long, 0.3–0.4 cm wide, the lobes elliptic, 1.3–2.2 cm long, 0.7–1.1 cm wide; anthers glabrous or pubescent along the connectives. Capsules 13–19 mm long, 9–13 mm wide, 4–5 mm thick. Seeds 0.8–1.2 mm long, conspicuously papillose. [2n = 28*.] Occurring on sea cliffs, 0–400 m, Kaʻali Cliff, Niʻihau, and the Nāpali Coast and Hāʻupu Ridge, Kauaʻi.

Campanulaceae_Clermontia_micrantha
Transcription:	11. Clermontia micrantha (Hillebr.) Rock. [Clermontia Hillebr. var. micrantha Hillebr.; C. multiflora Hillebr. var. micrantha Hillebr.]
Clermontia micrantha is rather common. Terrestrial shrubs 0.4-2 m tall. Leaves elliptic to oblong, blades 4-10 cm long, 1-2.5 cm wide, glabrous, margins callose-crenulate, apex acute or acuminate, base crenulate, petioles 1.5–4 cm long. Inflorescences 2–3(–5)-flowered, peduncles 5–10 mm long, pedicels 7–14 mm long; hypanthium obovoid to turbinate, 5–8 mm long, 3–7 mm wide; perianth rose to dark pink, 18–28 mm long, 3–5 mm wide, glabrous, the tube suberect, the lobes recurved, about as long as the tube; staminal column rose to dark pink, glabrous; anthers purplish, glabrous. Berries orange, obovoid, 12–15 mm long, 9–10 mm wide. Occurring in bogs and occasionally wet forest, 670–1,460 m, on Lāna‘i and West Maui (Pu‘ukukui, Mount 'Eke, Lanilili).—Plate 49. On Lāna‘i, it is known only from 3 specimens (Munro 333, BISH; Munro 391, BISH, L, M; Munro 930, BISH, L) collected in Kumoa Gulch during 1927-1929. An individual transplanted from Lāna‘i to Munro's garden on O‘ahu died in 1935 (Munro 9, BISH). A single plant believed to be a hybrid between this species and Clermontia kakeana was observed at Lanilili in 1984-1985 (Lammers & Sylva 5619, OS; Lammers 5847, BISH, OS, US).

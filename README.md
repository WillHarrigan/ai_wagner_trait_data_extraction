## ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿ Automated Extraction of Functional Trait Data from Hawaiian Plant Descriptions ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿
#### Mission Statement
Our research team is developing automated methods to extract functional trait data from unstructured text sources. Specifically, we are extracting trait data from the Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaiâ€˜i by Wagner, which provides detailed descriptions of over 3,000 Hawaiian plant species, including physiological and life cycle characteristics.

Each species is described in a dedicated passage presented in a narrative format. To streamline data extraction, we have implemented a flexible and adaptive prompt capable of handling variations in passage structure and linguistic diversity. This significantly accelerates the extraction process compared to manual annotation.

The overarching goal of this project is to advance the automation of data retrieval from extensive, non-standardized textual sources. Additionally, our work contributes to the development of a comprehensive plant trait database for Hawaiian flora.

#### Project Overview
Data Source: 

Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaiâ€˜i (Wagner)

Methodology:

Adaptive prompt engineering for automated text extraction
Handling variations in language and structure
Improving efficiency over manual data entry
Outcome: A structured plant trait database to support ecological research

To do list:
1. Need to improve the transcription of the text from the Wagner directly. There are some clear errors. 
2. Need to write a prompt that allows for more leniant analysis of True/False when comparing extracted data.
3. Need to run the full analysis and write code to calculate accuracy.
